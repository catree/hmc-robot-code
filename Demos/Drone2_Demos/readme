The files included:
Ardrone2.py - The updated version of the Ardrone Class which Alistair and Matt 
wrote.

Ardrone2_Sliders.py - Similar to the regular class with the exception that 
sliders are also present to edit specifics.

data.txt and data2.tx have dictionaries for the threshing of colors. Note: The 
heli2.py depends on these.

heli2.py is similar to heli.py written by Alistair and Matt - it's simply 
adapted for the second drivers. It is basically the original one they wrote with
little to no changes by me (Daisy).

Drone2_Demos.py is where the FSM of Drone2 are. This relies on the new version 2
drivers. This code pretty much works with both drivers.

---How To Run Demos ---
-connect to the drone's wifi
-(new terminal window) "roscore"
-(new terminal window) "rosrun ardrone2_mudd driver"
-(new terminal window) "python heli2.py"
-(new terminal window) "python Drone2_Demos.py"

Note: Make sure to edit the top of the Drone2_Demos.py if you're using the
roomba and if you're using the original ARDrone. The only reason for this is so
that the numbers are accurate for each task.
