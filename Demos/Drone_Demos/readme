heliImages.py was written by Alistair and Matt. These were built for the first
ARDrone. They display and image and publish the data for the thresholding box.

data.txt and data2.tx are color dictionaries that hold the slider values
neccessary to threshold into specific colors. Note: heliImages.py depends on 
these threshold values.

Drone_Demos.py is where the FSMs are located. These subscribes to heliImages.py
in order to aquire the information needed to complete it's tasks.

-(new terminal window) "roscore"

Note: Make sure to edit the top of the Drone_Demos.py if you're using the
