This demo actually needs no additional packaging to run. Hence, this README is
the only file in this directory. 

To run rgbdslam best, you should use strelka. If strelka is unavailable, 
arnold is the next best computer. On any of the others, you will likely have to
capture frames individaully as opposed to continously. 

To run the demo: 

1. Plug in the kinect to the wall and the computer
2. Open up a terminal (the directory doesn't matter)
3. Run 'roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch'
4. Use the space key to start recording continously, or the enter key to grab a
   single frame.
