This package contains demos for keyboard controlling the drone and directing it
into a variety of finite state machines. It relies on the ardrone2_mudd package
and the image_processing package. In order to run this demo, you can either 
launch everything manually, with the sequence of commands marked 'manual' below
or launch everything via the launch file in 'launch', which can be launched
with the sequence of commands marked 'launch' below. 

Manual Launch (in any directory):
1. Connect to the drone
2. Run 'rosrun ardrone2_mudd driver'
3. Run 'rosrun image_thresholder imageProcessor.py'
4. Run 'rosrun fsmTargetApproach xyApproach.py'

Launchfile:
1. Connect to the drone
2. Run 'rosrun ardrone2_mudd driver'
3. Run 'roslaunch fsmTargetApproach xyApproach.launch'

All the launch file does is run the image_thresholder and the finite state
machine
